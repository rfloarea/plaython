# Plaython

Some playful things written in python.

## Playthings (so far)

- Basic CLI seconds timer (see: [timer_sec.py](./timer_sec.py))
  - Learned about
    - import statements
    - time module
    - format strings (removed, but played with)
    - `.sleep` method
    - `input()` function
    - `int()` function
    - basic function, conditionals, and while loops
    - how to run scripts from terminal
- Basic CLI minute timer (see: [timer_min.py](./timer_min.py))
  - Learned about
    - simple uses of format strings
    - `len()` function
    - cleaner `while` loop logic (removed `if` condition within loop and simply allowed the loop to complete)
